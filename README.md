## Usage

1. Navigate to `localhost:2000`

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The project focused on creating client side, server side JavaScript, CSS page for styling, and an EJS file to render the html page. This project uses express and mongodb database.

## Optimizations

Styling can be enhanced in this project for future updates.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that this project has all the basic CRUD App functionality by using a personal built API with endpoints that allow the user to create, read, update, and delete content from the browser and database. In addition, I learned how there are different routes that can be made to do similar tasks after repeated trial and error.
